'''Thank you guys so much for the support you've given me within the past 10 months! Hope you look forward to upcoming sets! :)'''

'''This is an entry for the [[forum/6617|January 2023 ToTM Contest]]!'''

Hey everyone! I thought I might try out the ToTM contest, so I made this set! This cursor set uses the Gamepad (Or game controller) Emoji in the Windows 10 style. This also uses similar styled cursors too. I hope you enjoy these!

=== If there are any issues, please contact me! ===
'''Please do not reupload these and/or claim these as your own work.'''

Enjoy the set!
